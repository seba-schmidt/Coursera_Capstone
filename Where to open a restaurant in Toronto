            "source": "Toronto is a diverse city with about 2.7 million inhabitants, while the Greater Toronto Area is home to a total of about 6.4 million inhabitants. Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighborhoods and some larger neighborhoods covering a few square kilometers .\n\nAs mentioned, Toronto\u2019s neighborhoods are very different in terms of population density, but also in terms of \u201cidentity\u201d and the type of people living there. Nevertheless, everybody wants to eat and go to a good restaurant in their neighborhood. \n\nThe goal of this study is to enable prospective restaurant owners to identify the neighborhood(s) where it is best to open a new restaurant and also what cuisine might have higher chances of success. The recommendation will be based on the population density of each area, the restaurant density as well as the number of venues of each type of cuisine based on Foursquare data.",
